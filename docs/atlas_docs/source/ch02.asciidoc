[[write_how_you_want]]
== Write How You Want

When you are using Atlas to write your book, you have the option of writing in the wiki interface((("wiki interface"))) or locally on your own computer. This chapter covers each of those scenarios. As you write your book, you can jump back and forth between the two writing environments. As long as you are saving in the web interface or using git to `push` and `pull` from your local machine, you'll always be in sync.

[TIP]
.Get Your Gravatar
=======
You (((gravatar)))may notice that some users have personal icons in the Changes and Collaborators sections of Atlas. Those image icons are pulled in from http://en.gravatar.com/[Gravatar], based on the user's email address. Set up your Gravatar to get a more personalized icon.

=== Working in the Atlas Wiki

If you've used a wiki before, you will find the Atlas interface to be very familiar. In the following sections, you'll learn how to create and edit new files in the wiki interface.

.Invite Some Collaborators
****
Once you are working on a project in Atlas, you can invite additional collaborators(((collaborators, inviting))) at any time. First, create your project. Then, click on the Collaborators tab. Enter the mail address of anyone you'd like to collaborate with on your project. If you choose a permission type of Collaborator, the invited author will have full read and write access to your project, via the wiki interface and the git repository.

You can also remove collaborators using the same Collaborators tab.

[[creatingnewfiles]]
==== Creating New Files

When you create your book(((creating files))) in Atlas, it will have no files, as shown in <<blank_slate>>.

[[blank_slate]]
.When you create a new book in Atlas, you start off with a blank slate
image::images/blank_slate.png["A screenshot of the Atlas dashboard for a new project"]

You can create your first file by clicking on Open Editor. Atlas will recognize that your book has no files, and you will be prompted to create one. Click ``Create your first file'' and name the file, as shown in <<create_file>>.

[[create_file]]
.Create your first file
image::images/create_file.png["A screenshot of creating an new file in the Atlas user interface"]

Once you've created the file, you're ready to start writing!

[[working_with_asciidoc_text]]
==== Working with AsciiDoc Text in Atlas

When you're working in the Atlas wiki interface, you will need to write in AsciiDoc.footnote:[Atlas supports Markdown for less technically complex text. Ask your editor if Markdown is a good fit for your project.] See <<intro_to_asc>> for an introduction to AsciiDoc markup.

The Atlas wiki editor works just as you'd expect. Use the buttons to insert simple AsciiDoc markup. For example, <<atlas_editor>> shows what happens when you click the H1 button.

[[atlas_editor]]
.Use the Atlas wiki interface to write in your web browser
image::images/atlas_editor.png["A screenshot of the Atlas wiki interface"]

Once you've entered some text, click Save and your changes will be committed to a git repository that is created automatically each time you start a new book. Optionally, you can enter a log message(((entering a log message))) before you click Save, and it will be included with the commit to the git repository, as show in <<log_message>>. Read more about making the most of your git repository in <<working_locally>> and <<using_git_with_atlas>>.

[[log_message]]
.It's good practice to add a meaningful log message
image::images/log_message.png["A screenshot showing an example of entering a log message in the Atlas"]

Note also that you can use the File Manager drop-down to jump to other files or to create new ones.

[[adding_images]]
==== Adding Images via the Atlas Interface

You can upload images to your book directly in the Atlas wiki interface. Click on Image manager and then select Choose File and finally Upload, as shown in <<image_upload>>.

[[image_upload]]
.Upload your images within Atlas
image::images/image_upload.png["A screenshot of the Atlas image uploader"]

Once you've uploaded your image, Atlas will generate a thumbnail preview of that image, which you can see at any time by bringing up the Image manager.

[NOTE]
=========
At this time, if you upload an image via git, the image will not have a thumbnail preview within the Image manager.
=========

You can also use the Image manager to insert the AsciiDoc reference to that
image:

. Place the cursor where you'd like to insert the image within the text.
. Click on Image manager.
. Select the thumbnail preview of the image you've uploaded and click Insert (<<insert_image_asciidoc>>).

[[insert_image_asciidoc]]
.You've uploaded the image; now reference it within your document
image::images/insert_image_asciidoc.png["A screenshot showing how to highlight and insert a reference to an image from the Atlas image uploader"]

Once you click insert, Atlas will add AsciiDoc markup that looks something like the following to your document:

----
image::images/insert_image_asciidoc.png[]
----

Read more about figure and image markup in <<figures_and_other_images>> in <<intro_to_asc>>.

[[tracking_changes_in_atlas]]
=== Tracking Changes in Atlas

Each time you save a change in the wiki interface or use git to push a change to your repository (as described in <<committing_and_pushing>>), Atlas displays that change on the Changes tab.

[[changes_in_atlas]]
.An Atlas change box shows additions and deletions made to the text
image::images/changes_in_atlas.png["A screenshot of how Atlas displays edits to the text. Added text has a green background. Deleted text is crossed out and has a red background."]

<<changes_in_atlas>> shows a change that was saved to the repository via a `git push`. In this change notification box, Atlas displays the author who made the change along with the log message used during `git commit`. If the author were to use the Save button on the wiki interface (instead of git), as explained in <<working_with_asciidoc_text>>, the change would be captured and displayed in the same way.

[[working_locally]]
=== Working Locally

Atlas sits on top of a git repository, giving you the flexibility to write how and when you want. For example, suppose you have a long flight and want to write edit on the plane. No problem--just pull down your book files, make your changes locally, and then push them back up when you're connected to the Internet again. Or perhaps you'd rather skip the wiki interface entirely and work on your local machine exclusively. That's fine too.

[[cloning_your_book]]
==== Cloning Your Book

In order to work locally, you will need to have http://git-scm.com/[git] installed on your machine. The following section describes a few basic git commands to get you up and running, but see <<using_git_with_atlas>> for more details around using git with Atlas.

Once you have git installed, click on the Metadata tab in the Atlas interface to retrieve your git repository URL, as shown in <<git_repo_url>>.

[[git_repo_url]]
.Grab your git repository URL from the Metadata tab
image::images/git_repo_url.png["A screenshot of the Metadata tab in Atlas showing the git URL"]

Now that you have the URL, you can use git to clone it to your computer. Use the `git clone` command and enter your Atlas password. When you clone the repo, you can optionally add the name of the directory, like so:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://adam%40oreilly.com@atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065.git
   getting_started_with_atlas/

Cloning into getting_started_with_atlas...
remote: Counting objects: 338, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (337/337), done.
remote: Total 338 (delta 136), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (338/338), 4.10 MiB | 534 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (136/136), done.
----

The `clone` command will download all of the files into a directory named
_getting_started_with_atlas_, and that directory is now under version control
with git.

[NOTE]
========
All of the examples in this guide use the command line git client. If the
command line is not for you, there are several GUI git clients available for
Windows, OS X, and Linux.
========

[[committing_and_pushing]]
==== Committing and Pushing

Now that you've got a local checkout of your project, you can open and edit the _.asciidoc_ file. As explained in <<intro_to_asc>>, AsciiDoc is a text-based markup language. You can use any text editor to edit the files. <<editing_in_textmate>> shows edits being made to this chapter in TextMate, a text editor for the Mac.

[[editing_in_textmate]]
.Editing an AsciiDoc file in TextMate
image::images/editing_in_textmate.png["A screenshot of an AsciiDoc file in TextMate"]

Now it's time to commit the changes to the git repo. You can include a log message with `-m`. The `-a` means to include all changes.

[source,console]
----
$ git commit -a -m'added section on interfacing with the Atlas git backend'
[master 0e487ee] added section on interfacing with the Atlas git backend
 3 files changed, 46 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 images/editing_in_textmate.png
----

Finally, `push` your committed changes:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin
Counting objects: 11, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 54.03 KiB, done.

To https://adam%40oreilly.com@atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065.git
   ffb554d..90fd00f  master -> master
----

Now if you look in the Altas web interface, you will see the changes that you made locally reflected in the wiki interface.

[[fetching_and_pulling]]
==== Fetching and Pulling 

You can also use git to pull down changes that were made in the wiki environment or by other contributors. There are two ways of downloading changes. One way is to use `fetch` followed by `merge`, as in this example:

[source,console]
----
$ git fetch
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065
   cd86112..cba41ff  master     -> origin/master
----

`fetch` downloads the changes. Now use `merge` to bring your local files up to date:

[source,console]
----
$ git merge origin
Updating cd86112..cba41ff
Fast-forward
 ch02.asciidoc |    3 ++-
 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
----

Alternatively, you can use `pull`, which downloads the changes and merges them in with a single command:

[source,console]
----
$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 8, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
From https://atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065
   cba41ff..a972d49  master     -> origin/master
Updating cba41ff..a972d49
Fast-forward
 ch02.asciidoc |   25 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
 1 files changed, 25 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
----

Using `push` and `pull` to interface with your Atlas repo is the just the beginning of what you can do with git. Check out http://gitref.org/[Git Reference] and<<using_git_with_atlas>> to learn what else is possible.

[[resolving_conflicts]]
==== Resolving Conflicts

When you use `git merge` or `git pull`, git will attempt to combine all changes into one document. Sometimes, however, git will fail to combine the text and your AsciiDoc file will have a conflict. This situation may arise if, for example, two authors try to `push` changes to the same line of text. Conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this document, but the Git User’s Manual has an http://schacon.github.com/git/user-manual.html#resolving-a-merge[excellent overview] of git conflicts and how to resolve them.
